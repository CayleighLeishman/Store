# Overview

In this assingment I attempted to learn a new language Java. I attempted to learn classes, functions, loops and how to use Java in different ways. While I was able to learn these things, unfortunatly I couldn't apply everything as I hoped to and lost some of the working code I had.

# Store
It asks you for your name, and what items you want to buy and sends it out in the terminal!

I wrote this becuase I wanted to have a program that holds a shopping list. I originaly created this so I could get an estimate on how much my groceries would be, but I lost my functional code and I ran out of time, so I decided to go with making the grocery list.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio code, I implimented the library that allowed me to use util, which is a library that allows the program to take input from the user and use it in the program.

I used Javascript and I used Util.scanner to allow for user input in the program.

# Future Work

Ways I can improve:

* Item 1: Add a loop that allows the user to type in an item, one at a time rather than a bunch of text in one line

* Item 2: Add a class that would allow me to calculate the sales tax.

* Item 3: Creating the folder in github so it can properly save BEFORE working on the file. (I lost the only working code I had. I unfortunatly didn't save it properly and I had to start over. It was a sad day.)
